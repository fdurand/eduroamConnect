Application Usage:

First of all install Android application to your mobile device. 
Application can work with any Android device which supports 2.x 
series of version. Application's source code repository can be 
found on https://github.com/mesutcang/eduroamConnect. This 
application is open source. You can contact mesutcang@gmail.com 
for any questions or support for application. 

Then you can open the application. If you opened application manually,
you must provide a auto-configuration mobileconfig xml file url. You
can use download button to download xml configuration file from a 
user specified URL. This configuration file is the same as Apple's
configuration utility. So you can use this application to auto-connect
your any other network connection. Just prepare the xml configuration 
file. When the application is installed the application registers 
itself to open xml files default. So when you register an PacketFence
network, it redirects you to the configuration file download page. 
This configuration file is automatically opened with the application.
If it doesn't, you can open manually your application and download the
configuration file from the URL which is provided by PacketFence.

You define a username and password if you want. If you don't define 
a username and password, for WEP and WPA connections this fields aren't 
used to connect a network. For a 802.1x network connection if you provide 
a username and/or password it would be used to connect network. If you
don't specify a username and/or password if xml configuration file contains
and information about username and password fields, it would be used to
connect network.
